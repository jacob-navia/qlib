This is a public release of my version of the CEPHES Mathematical Library.R
 
This work is based on the work of Stephen L Moshier, the author of the CEPHES 
Mathematical Library.

The copyright notice of that library is as follows:

	Some software in this archive may be from the book _Methods and
	Programs for Mathematical Functions_ (Prentice-Hall or Simon & Schuster
	International, 1989) or from the Cephes Mathematical Library, a
	commercial product. In either event, it is copyrighted by the author.
	What you see here may be used freely but it comes with no support or
	guarantee.
	
	The two known misprints in the book are repaired here in the
	source listings for the gamma function and the incomplete beta
	integral.

Since the author allowed me to use his work freely, I have written a new version of it.

I thank Mr Moshier for publishing his work. I retain the same conditions as he did:
I retain my copyright for all the modifications I introduced in this release. 
What you see here can be used freely but it comes with no support or guarantee
unless you pay for it.
